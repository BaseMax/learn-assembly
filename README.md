# Learning Assembly by Solving

Welcome to **Learning Assembly by Solving**, a collection of 20 small assembly language programs designed to teach fundamental concepts through practical examples. Each program solves a specific problem, ranging from basic arithmetic to control structures, all written in x86-64 assembly using NASM syntax for Linux systems.

## Purpose

The goal is to learn assembly language by implementing solutions to common programming problems. Each `.S` file (e.g., `1.S`, `2.S`, ..., `20.S`) in the root directory corresponds to a question listed below, providing hands-on experience with low-level programming.

## Questions

1. Check if a number is even or odd

2. Find the maximum of two numbers

3. Compare two numbers and print "Equal" if they're equal

4. Add two numbers and print the result (as a character/digit if small)

5. Subtract two numbers and print the result

6. Count from 1 to 5 and print each number on a new line

7. Print the factorial of 5

8. Sum the numbers from 1 to 10

9. Check if a number is a multiple of 3

10. Print the first 5 even numbers

11. Reverse a 2-digit number (e.g., 42 → 24)

12. Convert a single digit (0-9) to ASCII and print it

13. Print "Positive" or "Negative" based on a signed number

14. Calculate and print 2^n for small n (like 0–5)

15. Check if a number is prime (try for small ones like 2–10)

16. Store 5 numbers in memory and find their sum

17. Swap two variables using a temporary register

18. Find the average of 3 numbers

18. Print the alphabet A to E using a loop

19. Take two numbers and print which one is closer to 10
